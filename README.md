## Deployment

This project is ready to be deployed on Vercel. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy.

### Steps to deploy:

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you don't have one
2. Connect your GitHub account to Vercel
3. Import this repository
4. Click "Deploy"

## How It Works

The animation uses CSS animations and JavaScript to create a realistic burning effect. The fire consists of multiple layers:

1. Base flames with dynamic movement
2. Floating sparks that rise from the fire
3. Smoke particles that drift upward
4. Glowing effects on the barn structure

The JavaScript adds interactivity, making the flames react to mouse movement across the screen.
